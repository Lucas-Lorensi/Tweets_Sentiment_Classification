# Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Predicting Tweet Sentiments

## Introduction

In this project, we'll explore a dataset containing only three key attributes related to Twitter data:

1. **textID**: A unique identifier for each piece of text (tweet).
2. **text**: The actual content of the tweet.
3. **sentiment**: The general sentiment expressed in the tweet (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

Our goal is to predict the sentiment associated with each analyzed tweet. To achieve this, we'll follow these steps:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- We'll perform an initial exploration of the data, visualizing key information without diving into complex statistical analyses.
- EDA will help us understand patterns, distributions, and potential outliers.

### 2. Data Splitting

- We'll split the dataset into training and test sets.
- The training set will be used to train our models, while the test set will evaluate their performance.

### 3. Classification Algorithms

- We'll apply different data classification algorithms to predict tweet sentiments.
- Each algorithm will undergo hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance.

### 4. Model Comparison

- After training the models, we'll compare their results.
- Which algorithm performs best? Are there trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability?

### 5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation

- We'll analyze the results of selected models.
- Can we explain the mistakes made by the models? What insights can we gain from misclassifications?

### 6. Project Discution

- We'll discuss potential limitations and ethical considerations related to the dataset and our approach.
